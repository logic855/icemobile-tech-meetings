# Virgilio and generators example.
`promises.js` demonstrates a convoluted asynchronous way to sum an array of numbers.
`generators.js` shows how you can do the same thing using generators.

To run `generators.js` you need to run node 0.11 with the harmony flag
```
    node --harmony generators.js
```

[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) is a nice way to run multiple node version in parallel.
