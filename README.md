# IceMobile Tech Meetings

This space is used from IceMobile developers to share thoughs, code and stuff presented during our (awesomes) internal tech meetings.

## Meeting rules
Some basic rules for setting up meetings:

* meetings should take place on fridays
* best time would be between 13:30 and 14:30, later is beer time, it's too important to be skipped
* nobody decide what is the topic of the next meeting, you can propose a topic opening a pull request on GitHub so we can vote for it
* once your proposal is merged, meeting is approved
* if you propose a meeting you are also responsible find a room for it and inform everybody with a nice calendar invitation
* meeting materials should be packed inside a fodler with the following format: `DD-MM-YYYY TOPIC_NAME`, it would be nice if it contains also a readme
